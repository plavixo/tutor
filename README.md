# Tutor

Tutor is the working title for a project (software and cultural) that intends to change the way we educate ourselves and others.

# The Portfolio Lens

## The Implicit Portfolio
From the moment you are born, you have a portfolio of what you can do. Initialy that isn't much.
When you enter schooling age, that portfolio becomes formalised. Competencies are clumped together in tests, and summarised into grades. This continues until you leave education, whether that is primary, secondary, or tertiary.

Every time we learn something, we add it to our portfolio.

A person _always_ has a portfolio of competencies - that portfolio is just the gigantum list of things they can do. A subset of that portfolio is formalised in formal education, but even when we don't formalise it or acknowledge it, it is still there.

## The current situation
Western education looks like a factory production line. We batch children into groups of 30, and we present the same information to them on the same day, at the same pace, in the same way. Nobel efforts are made to differentiate learning as much as possible, but within the structure of mainstream schooling, this can only go so far. The state gets as much education into a person as possible before they turn 18, and then removes the learning support.

Some people continue foramal education in the workplace. Some people follow hobbies or passions. Some people get stuck in a rut.

# The Competency Network Lens

Every cognitive competency has dependencies, otherwise known as prerequisites. These are things you have to be able to do, in order to be able to do the thing you want to do. We have an implict understanding of this - in order to be able to multiply, you have to be able to add. In order to be able to add, you have to be able to count.

We build competencies on competencies. A mathematics PhD student will be building on the mathematics they learned in their undergraduate degree, which built upon the maths they learned at high school, which built upon the maths the learned in primary school, which built upon their successes of counting in nursery school.

Any competency has dependencies on other competencies. These in turn have dependencies on other competencies. This relationship forms a competency network

We don't often represent these competency networks explicitly. They are implicitly shown in text books and tutorials, where a passage, page, or chapter works towards an outcome to be reached, and guides the consumer through all the prerequities needed. They hide in lists of learning outcomes for classes and courses.

## Formalising Competency Networks
Competency networks exist, and we can formalise them.
We end up with a huge network of competencies.



Imagine all the compenencies mapped in a single network. What would that look like?

Huge, for a start. Incomprehensably big. We need not try to imagine it all at once, but we can imagine some of the things we'd notice.

### Interrelation
We'd see that everything is interlinked. Competencies associated with Mathematics would be intertwined with Music. The Natural Sciences would be as intertwined as we know they are. Physics would lead to Electronics which would lead to Computer Science and Computer Programming, from the lowest level chip languages to the abstracted languages running the applications of the world today. Psychciatry, branching from biology, would entwine with Psychology, leading into Social Work fields. Languages would intertwine with Philosophy and Legal Systems. The network of all the competencies intertwined.

### Edges and Levels
We'd see competencies at the base of the map that reminded us of primary school education: Reading, writing, numeracy at the lowest level of complexity. We'd see the cutting edge of research at the top of the map, the new areas of discovery, and the edge of human understanding being gradually pushed up. We'd see the path from those early competencies to that research, every competency required to support the one at the top edge of the graph.
We'd also see some competencies lower in the dependency map than we might expect. We may see mathematics normally encountered at university having the same dependencies as competencies normally achieved in primary education. This makes sense. There are many areas of mathematics. Some are not explored until university, not because they are _harder_, but because we deem them as less relevant compared to subject areas, and so they are not taught in primary education. The point to note is that there is no cognitive nor academic reason why primary-aged students could not be achieving competence in _some_ "university-level" competencies.

## What would be the point?
Why would we want to formalise that network? Because of what it gives us.

### Resource Indexing
With a competency, the unique identifier of a competency can be used to tag a resource as being relevant to that competency.

A resource could be of almost any size - a whole book, to a part of a sentence in a book. A line of dialogue in a video, to a feature length film (There would almost certainly be questions about the efficiency of resource, or the applicability of all the parts!) The point to note is that resources can be widely varied.

Each and every competency could be tagged with many resources. There are so many open resources on the internet alone, let alone those held by companies.

#### What does it buy us

#### Inquisatory Resources

Resources need not just be explanatory, presentation resources - they could be inquisatory (assessment) resources. Some sentences in a book provide information - other sentences, in the form of questions, ask for information to be provided. Computer-aided-assessment question objects can ask a learner a to demonstrate a competency. By the learner succeeding or failing to demonstrate the competency with their answer, that assessment object can show whether they have or have not achieved the competency (see Competencies are Binary).

When an competency is associated with inquisatory resources, learners can access formative and diagnostic assessment.

### Tracking
With assessment of binary competencies, a learner's portfolio of competencies can be established specifically, with a high resolution.

### Routing
Given a network of competencies, if a learner is working towards achieving a competency, and that they have not yet achieved the competencies upon which it depends, then that learner knows the next small step that they need to take on the path to their target competency.

>This is transformative. When self-directed learners have to stumble along to work out what they need to know in order to reach their objective; that's research. Research is great, but it isn't an effective way of getting from A to B. In a network, the learner knows what the next competency is, and the next one, and the next one, all the way to their target.

(See: [Routing](#routing))

### Other Uses
* Network Comparison for profile matching for 
 * job roles, academic entrance requirements etc
 * accreditation
* Composing networks
 * Extending networks
 * Finding consensus and difference
 * Resource sharing

## So what?

In a world where competency maps exist and have explanatory and inquistatory resources attached, there are opportunities.

### The portfolio never stops. The learning never stops
Whether you are three or 93, you can track the competencies you have achieved. People learn, and achieve competencies, through school years, after school years, their whole lives long.

### Differentiated learning 

#### Resource type
With a world of resources to choose from, learners can select the resource that best suit the way they like to learn. Recommender algorithms could promote learning resources that "learners similar to you" found most effective.

#### Pace
Learners can progress at a pace that suits them for whatever competencies they are pursuing. The child who has a predisposition for English can achieve competencies quickly. That same child, who has less capability in mathematical thinking, can progress in those competencies at a slower pace, fully achieving each before moving on. As they mature, they may discover an area of particuar interest in maths, and steak off through those competencies.

#### Interaction type
Differentiated learning is not available to only those who study in isolation. A valid "Differentiated Learning Interaction" can be a classroom session, or an in-person course etc. It can be students forming a cohort to learn together with an instructor. 

Differentiated learning means that everyone's paths can look different. Some learn best alone, some in a group, some with a book, some with a video. These learning preferences can change with topic, with age, with life-circumstance - a single person may choose to be in a classroom to tackle competencies in English, prefer a book for maths, log into a virutal world to learn about geograph, listen to an audio book about history, meet with a study group in a lab for electronics, and have a partner with whom to study science.



#### Duty of care of under 18s
Schools are not just education shops. The outcomes of a good eduction are not measurable in merely cognitive competencies achieved.

What does this mean for (mainstream) schooling?



### Peer and group learning

### Putting control back in the hands of the learner



In a perfect world where everyone could slip into



#### Elaborations
##### Types of Resources
Written words - phrases, sentences, chapters, volumes in books, webpages, articles, magazines, letters, papers
Audio - seconds, minutes, hours, of voice, song, sounds, dialogue
Interactive - sorting or categorising games
Simulation - simulated worlds, buildings, laboratories
Images - illustrations, diagrams, photographs
Moving pictures - with or without sound - videos, animations

## Bringing the two together - the Portfolio of Competencies
Given that the youngest child has an implicit portfolio of things they can do, and given that we can represent competencies, where does that leave us?


## What would an ideal situation look like?

Imagine an education system in which learning doesn't stop - you don't stop being a student. From the moment you start learning to do acadmic things, your portfolio recognises those competencies.


People are empowered to learn what they want, when they want
Joined up
Education is available to more people
Education becomes personalised





Personal responsibility
  What if they don't have it?
    We work out what would work for them. Or we mainstream them. That's what differentated presetnation means.

Could reach those unreached by mainstream education
  those that don't get on with school
    behaviour
    anxiety
   aged out
   
could let people go and learn the real world and come back when they are ready
could focus on basic literacy and numeracy, and how to access education again

## Consider the impacts this could have on:

### Behaviour Management
### Passions

##Address
With no structure, kids will do whatever they want
  You have to get over the idea of kids have to be made to learn
Adults are not interested in education
Learning should be hard. People should have to earn it.
Pressure to keep learning more and more, earlier and earlier
Not everyone will agree on a single competency map
Psychomotor and Affective
Retaining competencies, periodic reassessment
Government brainwashing
  they control the education system anyway. This could expose people to more diversity of view. Is politics a cognitive competency? Kinda, yes, but very contextualised
Competency of judgement - what is a "good" person etc
Cognitive competencies are not everything. Schools do far more than teach cognitive competencies
  Absolutely. There is so much more to school, and life, than being able to demostrate cognitive competencies. This project is not antagonistic to that - quite the opposite! Cognitive competencies are an important part of school. By assisting with the aquisition of  cognitive competencies, this work could make more space in the school time table for all the things that _can't_ be taught away from school. Collaborative projects, team building, physical education, moral and pastoral education.
  Differentiated Learning means that there can be collaborative projects to learn soft skills. Qualifications could morph to be defined by the cognitive competencies a candidate must have, as well as a portfolio of _experiences_.


# To work in

## Routing

A competency is something a person can do. In this space, it serves us to restrict the definition: a competency is something we can observe someone doing.

A tool that serves us when talking about observable competencies is Bloom's Taxonomy of Cognitive Outcomes. A revised edition of his work lists six categories of demostration, along with more specific behaviours:

Relationship between competency and assessment
  there can be many assessments for a single competency. Or not

Why is it something we can observe someone doing?
