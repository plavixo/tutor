# Tutor

Tutor is the working title for a project (software and cultural) that intends to change the way we educate ourselves and others.

# The Portfolio Lens

## The Implicit Portfolio
From the moment you are born, you have an implict portfolio of what you can do. Initialy that isn't much.
When you enter schooling age, that portfolio becomes formalised. Competencies are clumped together in tests, and summarised into grades. This continues until you leave education, whether that is primary, secondary, or tertiary.

Every time we learn something, we add it to our portfolio of things we can do, whether we acknowledge it or not.

A person _always_ has a portfolio of competencies - that portfolio is just the gigantum list of things they can do. A subset of that portfolio is formalised in formal education, but even when we don't formalise it or acknowledge it, it is still there.

## The current situation
Western education looks like a factory production line. We batch children into groups of 30, and we present the same information to them on the same day, at the same pace, in the same way. Noble efforts are made to differentiate learning as much as possible, but within the structure of mainstream schooling, this can only go so far. The state gets as much education into a person as possible before they turn 18, and then removes the learning support.

Some people continue foramal education in the workplace. Some people follow hobbies or passions. Some people get stuck in a rut.

# The Competency Network Lens

Every cognitive competency has dependencies, otherwise known as prerequisites. These are things you have to be able to do, in order to be able to do the thing you want to do. We have an implict understanding of this - in order to be able to multiply, you have to be able to add. In order to be able to add, you have to be able to count.

We build competencies on competencies. A mathematics PhD student will be building on the mathematics they learned in their undergraduate degree, which built upon the maths they learned at high school, which built upon the maths the learned in primary school, which built upon their successes of counting in nursery school.

Any competency has dependencies on other competencies. These in turn have dependencies on other competencies. This relationship forms a competency network

We don't often represent these competency networks explicitly. They are implicitly shown in text books and tutorials, where a passage, page, or chapter works towards an outcome to be reached, and guides the consumer through all the prerequities needed. They hide in lists of learning outcomes for classes and courses.

## Formalising Competency Networks
Competency networks exist, and we can formalise them.

Imagine all the compenencies mapped in a single network. What would that look like?

Huge, for a start. Incomprehensably big. We need not try to imagine it all at once, but we can imagine some of the things we'd notice.

### Interrelation
We'd see that everything is interlinked. Competencies associated with Mathematics would be intertwined with Music. The Natural Sciences would be as intertwined as we know they are. Physics would lead to Electronics which would lead to Computer Science and Computer Programming, from the lowest level chip languages to the abstracted languages running the applications of the world today. Psychciatry, branching from biology, would entwine with Psychology, leading into Social Work fields. Languages would intertwine with Philosophy and Legal Systems. The network of all the competencies intertwined.

### Edges and Levels
We'd see competencies at the base of the map that reminded us of primary school education: Reading, writing, numeracy at the lowest level of complexity. We'd see the cutting edge of research at the top of the map, the new areas of discovery, and the edge of human understanding being gradually pushed up. We'd see the path from those early competencies to that research, every competency required to support the one at the top edge of the graph.

We'd also see some competencies lower in the dependency map than we might expect. We may see mathematics normally encountered at university having the same dependencies as competencies normally achieved in primary education. This makes sense. There are many areas of mathematics. Some are not explored until university, not because they are _harder_, but because we deem them as less relevant compared to subject areas, and so they are not taught in primary education. The point to note is that there is no cognitive nor academic reason why primary-aged students could not be achieving competence in _some_ "university-level" competencies.

## What would be the point?
Why would we want to formalise that network? Because of what it gives us.

### Resource Indexing
With a competency, the unique identifier of a competency can be used to tag a resource as being relevant to that competency.

A resource could be of almost any size - a whole book, to a part of a sentence in a book. A line of dialogue in a video, to a feature length film (There would almost certainly be questions about the efficiency of resource, or the applicability of all the parts!) The point to note is that resources can be widely varied.

Each and every competency could be tagged with many resources. There are so many open resources on the internet alone, let alone those held by companies.

#### Inquisatory Resources

Resources need not just be explanatory, presentation resources - they could be inquisatory (assessment) resources. Some sentences in a book provide information - other sentences, in the form of questions, ask for information to be provided. Computer-aided-assessment question objects can ask a learner a to demonstrate a competency. By the learner succeeding or failing to demonstrate the competency with their answer, that assessment object can show whether they have or have not achieved the competency (see Competencies are Binary).

When an competency is associated with inquisatory resources, learners can access formative and diagnostic assessment.

### Tracking
With assessment of binary competencies, a learner's portfolio of competencies can be established specifically, with a high resolution.

### Routing
Given a network of competencies, if a learner is working towards achieving a competency, and that they have not yet achieved the competencies upon which it depends, then that learner knows the next small step that they need to take on the path to their target competency.

>This is transformative. When self-directed learners have to stumble along to work out what they need to know in order to reach their objective; that's research. Research is great, but it isn't an effective way of getting from A to B. In a network, the learner knows what the next competency is, and the next one, and the next one, all the way to their target. This is putting control in the hands of the learner. They are empowered to be independent.

(See: [Routing](#routing))

### Other Uses
* Network Comparison for profile matching for 
 * job roles, academic entrance requirements etc
 * accreditation
* Composing networks
 * Extending networks
 * Finding consensus and difference
 * Resource sharing

## So what?

In a world where competency maps exist and have explanatory and inquistatory resources attached, there are opportunities.

### The portfolio never stops. The learning never stops
Whether you are three or 93, you can track the competencies you have achieved. People learn, and achieve competencies, through school years, after school years, their whole lives long.

### Differentiated learning 

#### Resource type
With a world of resources to choose from, learners can select the resource that best suit the way they like to learn. Recommender algorithms could promote learning resources that "learners similar to you" found most effective.

#### Pace
Learners can progress at a pace that suits them for whatever competencies they are pursuing. The child who has a predisposition for English can achieve competencies quickly. That same child, who has less capability in mathematical thinking, can progress in those competencies at a slower pace, fully achieving each before moving on. As they mature, they may discover an area of particuar interest in maths, and steak off through those competencies.

#### Interaction type
Differentiated learning is not available to only those who study in isolation. A valid "Differentiated Learning Interaction" can be a classroom session, or an in-person course etc. It can be students forming a cohort to learn together with an instructor. 

Differentiated learning means that everyone's paths can look different. Some learn best alone, some in a group, some with a book, some with a video. These learning preferences can change with topic, with age, with life-circumstance - a single person may choose to be in a classroom to tackle competencies in English, prefer a book for maths, log into a virutal world to learn about geograph, listen to an audio book about history, meet with a study group in a lab for electronics, and have a partner with whom to study science.


### What does this mean for (mainstream) schooling?
When considering education, particuarly when those considerations include the education of children, there is a persumption that I am taking a shot at schools. I am not.
There is so much more to school, and life, than being able to demostrate cognitive competencies. This project is not antagonistic to the role of schools - quite the opposite!
Schools are not just cognitive competencies shops. The outcomes of a good eduction are not measurable merely in cognitive outcomes achieved.

However, cognitive competencies _are_ undeniably an important part of education, and schools have responsiblities for the cognitive education of their students. By assisting with the aquisition of  cognitive competencies, this work could make more space in the school time table for all the things that _can't_ be taught away from school: collaborative projects, team building, physical education, moral and pastoral education, etc.

Consider some of the roles, other than the teaching of cognitive competencies, that schools play


### Social, affective, psychomotor, and other non-cognitive competencies
Schools educate in so many ways. They teach valuable social skills, and expose their students to new experiences. They teach resiliance, empathy, grit, determination, politics, and many other skills. These skills are not addressed by this work; these essential skills must still be taught.  
Practical skills in Art, Music, Domestic Science, Design and Technology, Practical Electronics need skilled teachers and equipped spaces to be taught effectively.
Differentiated Learning means that there collaborative projects are a valid approach to learning, with the benefit of simultaneously exposing students to the opportunity to learn soft skills. 
Qualifications could morph to be defined by the cognitive competencies a candidate must have, as well as a portfolio of _experiences_ they must have undertaken.

### Pastoral
Schools provide vital services for children. Pastoral care is a huge remit of schools. Teaching about psychologial, emotional, and sexual health is vital. Teachers, developing close working relationships with students notice changes, from sadness and health concerns, through to depression, neglect, extremism etc

### Childcare
A function of schools is to provide childcare. This enables their parents to work.
Whatever shape this project takes in supporting one of the many aspects of schooling, there will need to be some form of childcare for working parents.

### Teaching cognitive competencies
Schools and teachers teach cognitive competencies. This project does not seek to remove that privallage, but instead to lighten the burdan. There are some things that remain most effective with the human touch.
Consider diagnostic assessment - working out _why_ a learner is stuck on something. A learner may be struggling with a misconception, with confusion over langage, or having not fully grasped a prerequisite. It is like that a teacher will be far better placeed to track those isssues down and rectify them.  
Teachers can play a overwhelmingly significant role in motivating students, building confidence, and inspiring courage.


### for learning
There are certain cognitive competencies that we, as a society, have decided people should have before they leave formal education. Key skills in reading, writing, numeracy are considered essential, and we compel people to pursue these competencies until they attain them, or become old enough that we can no longer legally compel them. Schools are responsible for ensuring people achieve those competencies before they age out of the school system.

The ability to track students' specific competencies individually is a tool teacher can leverage to quickly spot when students are falling behind where they might reasonably be expected to be. With this safety net, teachers can afford students more freedom, to pursue an area of passion intensively for a while, leaving other areas to fall behind, so long as they don't fall _too_ far behind.

## What would this look like (in an idealised world)?

People are empowered to learn what they want, when they want. It is a joined up in the back end, though may be presented and experienced in myriad ways by the person thoughout their lifetime.
Education becomes personalised, accessible to everybody. It could better reach those people not presently well served by mainstream eduation, those that those that have issues with attending school for behavioural or mental health issues, or simply the people that have reached the age of 18 or have finished university.
Thinking outside of our own county, a competency system that empowers self-directed learners could extend the reach of high quality education around the world. Many cognitive outcomes ar universal - the fundametals of matematics in the UK is the same as in the poorest parts of Africa, chemical reactions in the USA are the same as those in economically deprived areas of Asia. Compared to creating a stable and mature education infrastructure, flying in a reasonable technology infrastructure is fast and easy. With technology, people in poor circumstances could access at least cognitive competency education, increasing their skills.

Over time, we could see a shift in culture. If education is made accessible to all people at all stages of their lives, the need to achieve certain competencies by a certain age seems less valid.
We could let people go and learn the real world and come back to education when they are ready. Go work in a mechanics garage for a few months, get relevance of numeracy when measuring anc calculating oil volumes and parts sizes, or taking money from customers.
Learning Hubs may emerge, with or without school involvement, with tax-payer funded teachers there to support all learners. We could see elective classes attended by a 35 year old sitting alongside a teenager alongside a 10 year old.
Compulsory schooling could focus on basic literacy and numeracy, and how to access further education again. Education becomes on demand, because you need it for your workplace, or for passion.
Schools become specialised Learning Hubs with additional remits, serving the needs of their students, with less of the burdan associated with responsbility for the students' cognitive competence outcomes.
Classes would still exist for those that wanted them.
More facilitiators
Behaviour Management wouldn't be a thing, at least not in the "disrupting the classroom way it is now"
People could more easily follow their passions, and perhaps turn them into careers.


## Address
With no structure, kids will do whatever they want
  This isn't true for all children. 
  For those that struggle to focus or find their passion, differentited learning could look like them attending something that looks a lot like a mainstream school. Or they may be better suited to starting a part-time workplace apprenticeship very early, to contextualise their learning, allowing them to return to more full-time education path with a renewed sense of motivation in the future.
Adults are not interested in education
  This is not true for all adults, and not true for all stages of life. One of the affordances of the persistant portfolio model is that people can start, stop, slow down, speed up their learning at any point. They may learn things in the real world, away from any tracking system, and choose to add those skils to their materialised portfolio later.
Learning should be hard. People should have to earn it.
  Differentiated Learning means that people can quickly achieve competencies that they have a natural disposition for, and more quickly meet the competencies on the edge of the capabilites. With a competency based system, learners can spend more time in healthy struggle that stretches their capabilities.
Pressure to keep learning more and more, earlier and earlier
  This is a concern, but because there is quite explicitly no upper limit to the competency network, there is only so far this can be taken. "Finishing" is not humanly feasible.
Not everyone will agree on a single competency map
  No. Lets talk about folksonomy and composing maps later
Psychomotor and Affective domains
  Are not covered by this work. They are presently addressed by other education interventions.
Retaining competencies, periodic reassessment
  We forget things that we have not revisited - the forgetting curve. A competency based system as described is well places to periodically assess competencies that have been achieved. This revision can keep more competencies at the ready, though if you have forgotten them, then you are likely not using them in your life, there is a question of why. Learning a langage is a great example of something you'd want to keep fresh.
They who control the learning network can "brainwash" the citizenry
  The government controls the education system anyway. This kind of system could expose people to more diversity of viewpoint. 
  It gets very shaky when value judgements are mascaraded as cognitive outcomes:
  "By the end of the intervention, the student will be able to categorise Trump as a good president".
  Are value-judgements a cognitive competency? Yes, but they are very contextualised. All cognitive outcomes are, though most of the time we overlook the context:
  "By the end of the intervention, the studeent will be able calculate 1+1"
  This the answer to the question "What is 1+1?" would be 2 in the context of our day to day, base10 (decimal) number system, but would be "10" in a base2 (binary) number system.

#### Elaborations
##### Types of Resources
Written words - phrases, sentences, chapters, volumes in books, webpages, articles, magazines, letters, papers
Audio - seconds, minutes, hours, of voice, song, sounds, dialogue
Interactive - sorting or categorising games
Simulation - simulated worlds, buildings, laboratories
Images - illustrations, diagrams, photographs
Moving pictures - with or without sound - videos, animations

##### Types of Routing

* Teacher-Set
 * An authority suggests an optimal route through a subnetwork.
* Normative Fail-Safe
 * A route is adapted with respect to the performance of the students using it. If more students are successful with a particular route, then this route could be promoted. Similarly, if many students struggle on a particular route, then this should be an indication that the route and the relevant part of the network should be inspected for faults.
* *Student-Chosen
 * Students choose the next competency they want to achieve.
* Patterned
 * It is possible that further development will reveal certain patterns within the network; topographical patterns of capability, subject matter, or both. This is similar to the intermediate representation tiling concept in compiler engineering. There may be optimal ways of routing through such repeating patterns.
* Subject Matter or Behaviour Type
 * Certain subject matter topics or items may be “easier”, or more efficacious for certain students, particularly when considering student background and prior experience. Strategic routing to those ILOs may be employed to optimise student engagement


##### What is in a competency

A competency is something a person can do. In this space, it serves us to restrict the definition: a competency is something we can observe someone doing.

A tool that serves us when talking about observable competencies is Bloom's Taxonomy of Cognitive Outcomes. A revised edition of his work lists six categories of demostration, along with more specific behaviours:
![alt text](https://s3.amazonaws.com/vuweb-s3-vuwebstaticassets-1i6c9zhn31ti6/vu-wp0/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/2019/03/27124326/Blooms-Taxonomy.jpg "bloom's taxonomy from Vanderbilt University Center for Teaching")


There is a strong relationship between competency and assessment - they are in some ways interchangable. Look up "Knowledge Space Theory". There can be many assessments for a single competency. Or not.

Why is it something we can observe someone doing?
