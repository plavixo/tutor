# Tutor

Tutor is the working title for a project that intends to change the way we educate ourselves and others.

# The Portfolio Lens

## The Implicit Portfolio
From the moment you are born, you have a portfolio of what you can do. Initialy that isn't much.
When you enter schooling age, that portfolio becomes formalised. Competencies are clumped together in tests, and summarised into grades. This continues until you leave education, whether that is primary, secondary, or tertiary.

Every time we learn something, we it to our portfolio.

A person _always_ has a portfolio of competencies - that portfolio is just the gigantum list of things they can do. A subset of that portfolio is formalised in formal education, but even when we don't formalise it or acknowledge it, it is still there.

## The current situation
Western education looks like a factory production line. We batch children into groups of 30, and we present the same information to them on the same day, at the same pace, in the same way. Nobel efforts are made to differentiate learning as much as possible, but within the structure of mainstream schooling, this can only go so far. The state gets as much education into a person as possible before they turn 18, and then removes the learning support.

Some people continue foramal education in the workplace. Some people follow hobbies or passions. Some people get stuck in a rut.

# The Competency Network Lens

Every cognitive competency has dependencies - things you have to be able to do, in order to be able to do the thing you want to do. 


## What would an ideal situation look like?

Imagine an education system in which learning doesn't stop - you don't stop being a student. From the moment you start learning to do acadmic things, your portfolio recognises those competencies.


People are empowered to learn what they want, when they want
Joined up
Education is available to more people
Education becomes personalised



You have to get over the idea of kids have to be made to learn

Personalised
topics
sequence
presentation
  audio

  tutorial
  gamified or point and click


Could still have classroom groups
Could still have collaborative projects to learn soft skills

Personal responsibility
  What if they don't have it?
    We work out what would work for them. Or we mainstream them. That's what differentated presetnation means.

Could reach those unreached by mainstream education
  those that don't get on with school
    behaviour
    anxiety
   aged out
   
could let people go and learn the real world and come back when they are ready
could focus on basic literacy and numeracy, and how to access education again

## Consider the impacts this could have on:

### Behaviour Management
### Passions


With no structure, kids will do whatever they want
Adults are not interested in education
